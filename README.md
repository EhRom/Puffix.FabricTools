# Fabric Tools Console App

The **Fabric Tools Console App** is a console application to perform some automatisation tasks, based on the [Fabric REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/using-fabric-apis) funcitonnalities.

[![.NET](https://github.com/EhRom/Puffix.FabricTools/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EhRom/Puffix.FabricTools/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

  - [Assign a workspace list to a capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/core/workspaces/assign-to-capacity).

    > The capacity ID and the workspace list must be filled in a configuration file. Sample:

    ```json
    {
		"capacityId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"workpsaceIdCollection": [
			"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
			"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

		]
    }
	```

  - [Unassign a workspace list from a capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/core/workspaces/unassign-from-capacity).

    > The capacity ID and the workspace list must be filled in a configuration file. Sample:

    ```json
    {
		"workpsaceIdCollection": [
			"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",

## Configure

The steps to create the Service principal / **Microsoft Entra App** are available in this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/get-started/create-entra-app).

The tenant and the **Microsoft Entra App** ID need to be reference in the app `appSettings.json` file or in a new one, called `appSettings.local.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "clientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Replace the `clientId` field by the Microsoft Entra App ID, and the tenant ID with the tenant ID of your Microsoft Entra App ID and Fabric resources.
